## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) assessment** for GetsIt2U, a global shipping platform contracted by the U.S. government. The project focuses on **Azure cloud security**, identifying risks, mapping compliance gaps, and recommending remediation strategies for NIST SP 800-53, PCI DSS, and FISMA compliance.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify and assess cloud security risks in Azure  
- Map risks to relevant compliance frameworks  
- Provide actionable remediation recommendations  

---

## 🛠️ Key Deliverables
- **REPORT.md** – Detailed risk and compliance assessment  
- **PDF Report** – Full-color tables, charts, and visuals ([Download PDF](docs/report.pdf))  
- **Snapshot** – 4-page case study with risk and compliance tables ([View snapshot PDF](docs/snapshot.pdf))  

---

## 🔎 Highlights
- Access Controls, Disaster Recovery, and Vulnerability Management assessment  
- Compliance mapping to **PCI DSS**, **FISMA**, and **NIST CSF**  
- Recommendations for RBAC implementation, backup verification, and vulnerability scanning  
- Secure network topology design following least-privilege principles
