# Azure Cloud Compliance Assessment (Simulated Project)

📌 **Overview**  
This project was completed as part of my graduate studies in cybersecurity and is based on a fictional scenario.  
I acted as a GRC analyst assessing compliance gaps during a simulated Azure cloud migration for a government-contracted logistics company.  

📊 **Key Deliverables**  
- Risk Summary Table with impact and likelihood scoring  
- Compliance Mapping Table aligned with **NIST SP 800-53** and **PCI DSS v4**
- Secure Network Topology designed with least privilege principles
- Remediation recommendations (RBAC, backup strategy, vulnerability management program)  

🛠 **Skills & Frameworks Demonstrated**  
- Risk assessment & prioritization  
- Multi-framework compliance mapping (NIST SP 800-53, PCI DSS and FISMA)  
- Azure cloud security recommendations  
- GRC reporting and documentation
