## 📖 Project Overview

**Project Goal:**  
Simulate and document GRC compliance gaps and provide technical recommendations for cloud migration to Azure.

**Highlights:**
- Identified key compliance gaps: access controls, backups, and vulnerability scanning.
- Mapped gaps to **NIST SP 800-53** and **PCI DSS** requirements.
- Provided actionable remediation steps and a secure network topology design.
- Includes a **snapshot case study** for quick reference.

## 🛠 Technical Recommendations

**Key Recommendations from the Project:**
1. Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) within segmented Azure Resource Groups to enforce least privilege.
2. Establish verified backup schedules for mission-critical data.
3. Define a vulnerability management program with periodic scanning and remediation.

These steps strengthen compliance posture while improving operational resilience and security.
